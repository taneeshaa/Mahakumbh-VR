1. How to run project:

Install Metaquest developer
Connect your MetaQuest device to your development machine using a USB cable.
Open the Unity project that you want to deploy to the MetaQuest device.
In Unity, go to "File" > "Build Settings" and select the target platform as MetaQuest.
Click on "Build and Run" to build and deploy it to the connected MetaQuest device.
Run apk through cable link

2. Packages used- 

xr interaction toolkit
Openxr
oculus developer hub(for vr development)
unity asset store for assets

3. About the project:

We have developed a VR first aid training platform “Panacea” designed to provide an immersive and interactive learning experience for individuals of all ages. The project aims to create a comprehensive virtual reality environment where users can learn and practice essential first aid skills in a realistic setting.
The course will cover a wide range of first aid techniques, including panic attack, electric shock, asthma, CPR-(AED), wound care, and emergency response procedures. Users will be able to interact with virtual patients, assess their conditions, and apply appropriate first aid measures in real-time scenarios .
The VR environment will simulate various emergency situations which a person might face in day to day life, such as panic attacks, electric shock, suffocation or blocked airways and household mishaps, to help users develop the necessary skills and confidence to respond effectively in real-life emergencies.
The project will also incorporate a certificate of completion which will be validated by certain organizations and universities that we will collaborate with. 


4. Idea Description
The project aims to develop a VR-based first aid training program. Trainees will immerse themselves in realistic virtual environments and interact with simulated emergency scenarios, such as cardiac arrest, panic attack, electric shock etc. The VR experience will provide interactive guidance, haptic feedback, and performance evaluation, ensuring trainees learn and practice first aid skills effectively in a safe and controlled virtual environment.

6. features in simulation

Interactive Scenarios: The simulation could present various interactive scenarios where trainees are required to provide first aid in different emergency situations such as cardiac arrest, choking, or severe bleeding.

Realistic Environments: The VR training could immerse trainees in realistic environments such as homes, workplaces, or public spaces to simulate real-life emergency situations.

Haptic Feedback: The simulation could incorporate haptic feedback to provide a sense of touch and realism, allowing trainees to feel the pressure and resistance when performing first aid techniques.

Multiplayer Collaboration: Trainees could collaborate with other users in the VR environment to practice teamwork and coordination in providing first aid.

Performance Evaluation: The simulation could include a feature to assess trainees' performance in providing first aid, providing feedback and guidance for improvement.

Adaptive Scenarios: The VR training could adapt the scenarios based on the trainees' responses, providing a dynamic and personalized learning experience.

Instructional Guidance: The simulation could offer instructional guidance and step-by-step demonstrations of first aid techniques to ensure trainees understand and apply the correct procedures.

8. Explain code core-logic,functionality

(I) XR Interaction Toolkit (VR functionality)

 XR Origin: Manages the position and orientation of interactable objects, ensuring they behave as expected in the virtual environment, and facilitating consistent interactions for users.

Locomotion: Enables user movement within the VR space, offering various locomotion methods such as teleportation, smooth movement, or custom locomotion systems for a seamless user experience.

Snap Turn: Allows users to rotate their viewpoint in discrete increments, providing a comfortable and controlled way to change their orientation in the virtual environment.

Interactable Objects: Provides a framework for objects within the VR environment that can be interacted with, allowing users to pick up, manipulate, and interact with virtual objects, enhancing immersion and engagement.

(II) Unity Codebase Explaination

The Unity codebase serves as the foundation for the game or application developed in Unity and is essential for collaboration, maintenance, and further development. It is typically stored in a version control system, such as Git, and may be organized into directories and subdirectories based on the structure of the Unity project.

C# scripts: These are like written instructions that define how different parts of the game or application should behave.

Scenes and assets: These represent different levels or sections of the game and contain various elements such as characters, objects, and their behaviors.

Configuration files: These hold settings and options for the game, similar to the game's preferences.

Prefabs: These are pre-made objects that can be reused throughout the game to build different parts of the game.

Plugins and extensions: These provide extra features, like making the game look more realistic or adding special effects.

Testing code: Scripts for testing the game to ensure everything works as it should.

Version control information: Details related to managing changes and updates to the game's code and assets.
